# ðŸš€ Phase 3 Migration Instructions

## Problem Solved
This migration resolves the error:
```
Error: Failed to get active sync operations: relation "public.sync_operations" does not exist
```

## Quick Fix (Recommended)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `lkolpgpmdculqqfqyzaf`
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Migration Script
1. Copy the entire content from `phase3-migration.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the script

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see messages like:
```
NOTICE: sync_operations table created successfully
NOTICE: connection_status table created successfully  
NOTICE: sync_status_snapshots table created successfully
NOTICE: Phase 3 migration completed successfully!
```

## What This Migration Creates

### Tables
- **`sync_operations`** - Real-time sync operation tracking
- **`connection_status`** - Client connection monitoring
- **`sync_status_snapshots`** - System health snapshots

### Functions
- **`update_sync_operation_progress()`** - Update operation progress
- **`complete_sync_operation()`** - Mark operations as complete
- **`create_sync_status_snapshot()`** - Create system snapshots

### Indexes
- Performance-optimized indexes for all sync tables

### Triggers
- Real-time notification triggers for sync status changes

## After Migration

1. **Restart your development server** (if running)
2. **Test the sync functionality** - the error should be resolved
3. **Check the admin panel** - sync status monitoring should work

## Verification

Run this in your browser to verify:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/setup-phase3
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "âœ… Phase 3 is fully set up",
  "existing_tables": ["sync_operations", "connection_status", "sync_status_snapshots"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get permission errors:
1. Make sure you're using the **service role key** (not anon key)
2. Check that RLS (Row Level Security) allows the operations
3. Verify your Supabase project permissions

### If tables still don't exist:
1. Check the SQL Editor for any error messages
2. Try running each CREATE TABLE statement individually
3. Verify you're connected to the correct database

### If the error persists:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Restart your development server
3. Check the browser console for any new errors

## Manual Alternative

If the SQL script doesn't work, you can create the tables manually:

1. **sync_operations table**: Copy lines 10-25 from `phase3-migration.sql`
2. **connection_status table**: Copy lines 27-40 from `phase3-migration.sql`  
3. **sync_status_snapshots table**: Copy lines 42-55 from `phase3-migration.sql`
4. **Indexes**: Copy lines 60-65 from `phase3-migration.sql`

Run each section separately in the SQL Editor.

## Success Indicators

After successful migration:
- âœ… No more "sync_operations does not exist" errors
- âœ… Sync status monitoring works in admin panel
- âœ… Real-time sync operation tracking available
- âœ… Connection status indicators functional

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in your dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your database has the necessary permissions
4. Try the manual table creation approach above
