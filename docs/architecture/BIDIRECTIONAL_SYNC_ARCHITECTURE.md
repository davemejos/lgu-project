# Bidirectional Sync Architecture - LGU Project

> **Moved from**: `docs/BIDIRECTIONAL_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md` (Phase 1 Documentation)

## Overview

The LGU Project now features a **complete enterprise-grade bidirectional synchronization system** between Cloudinary and Supabase. This architecture ensures 100% persistent mirroring with professional-level reliability, performance, and data integrity.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### **Core Services**

1. **SupabaseMediaService** (`src/lib/supabaseMediaService.ts`)
   - Complete CRUD operations for media assets
   - Advanced search and filtering
   - Sync status management
   - Real-time statistics
   - Audit trail logging

2. **BidirectionalSyncService** (`src/lib/bidirectionalSyncService.ts`)
   - Perfect bidirectional synchronization
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Batch processing for performance
   - Error recovery and retry logic
   - Webhook integration

3. **Enhanced API Routes**
   - `/api/cloudinary/media` - Database-backed media operations
   - `/api/cloudinary/sync` - Bidirectional sync triggers
   - `/api/cloudinary/webhook` - Real-time Cloudinary notifications
   - `/api/cloudinary/upload` - Enhanced upload with sync

### **Database Schema (Supabase)**

```sql
-- Core media assets table
media_assets (
  id, cloudinary_public_id, cloudinary_version, cloudinary_signature,
  file_size, mime_type, format, width, height, folder, tags,
  secure_url, resource_type, sync_status, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Comprehensive audit trail
media_sync_log (
  operation, status, cloudinary_public_id, source, triggered_by,
  error_message, processing_time_ms, created_at
)

-- Usage tracking
media_usage (
  media_asset_id, usage_type, reference_table, reference_id
)

-- Organization collections
media_collections (
  name, description, is_public, created_by
)
```

## 🔄 Sync Flow Architecture

### **1. Upload Flow (Admin → Cloudinary → Database)**

```
User Upload → Cloudinary Widget → Cloudinary Storage → Webhook → Database Sync
```

1. User uploads via Cloudinary widget
2. File stored in Cloudinary with metadata
3. Cloudinary sends webhook notification
4. Webhook handler syncs metadata to Supabase
5. Real-time UI update via database subscription

### **2. Delete Flow (Admin → Database → Cloudinary)**

```
User Delete → Database Soft Delete → Sync Service → Cloudinary Delete → Confirmation
```

1. User selects items for deletion
2. Items soft-deleted in database (marked as pending)
3. Sync service processes pending deletions
4. Items deleted from Cloudinary
5. Database records marked as synced

### **3. Bidirectional Sync Flow**

```
Cloudinary ←→ Sync Service ←→ Supabase Database
```

**Cloudinary → Database:**
- Fetch all resources from Cloudinary
- Compare with database records
- Update/create missing or changed items
- Handle version conflicts intelligently

**Database → Cloudinary:**
- Process pending operations (deletes, updates)
- Sync metadata changes to Cloudinary
- Handle failed operations with retry logic

## 🛡️ Data Integrity & Conflict Resolution

### **Version Control**
- Cloudinary version numbers tracked in database
- Signature verification for data integrity
- Timestamp-based conflict resolution
- Automatic retry for failed operations

### **Sync Status Management**
- `synced` - Perfect sync between systems
- `pending` - Operation waiting for sync
- `error` - Failed operation requiring attention

### **Error Recovery**
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error logging
- Manual sync triggers for recovery
- Graceful degradation on failures

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### **Database Performance**
- Optimized indexes for all query patterns
- Efficient pagination with cursor-based navigation
- GIN indexes for tag arrays
- Composite indexes for complex queries

### **Sync Performance**
- Batch processing (100 items per batch)
- Parallel processing where safe
- Incremental sync based on timestamps
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets

### **Caching Strategy**
- Database serves as persistent cache
- No repeated API calls for browsing
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Optimized image URLs with transformations

## 🔐 Security & Reliability

### **Webhook Security**
- Signature verification for all webhooks
- Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- Rate limiting and abuse protection
- Secure error handling without data leaks

### **Data Protection**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- User-based access controls
- Audit trail for all operations
- Soft deletes for data recovery

### **Reliability Features**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Graceful fallback behaviors
- Health monitoring and alerting

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### **Real-time Statistics**
```typescript
{
  total_assets: number,
  total_images: number,
  total_videos: number,
  total_size: number,
  synced_assets: number,
  pending_assets: number,
  error_assets: number
}
```

### **Sync Status Tracking**
```typescript
{
  last_sync: timestamp,
  is_synced: boolean,
  pending_operations: number,
  sync_in_progress: boolean,
  last_error: string | null
}
```

### **Audit Trail**
- Complete operation history
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error analysis and trends
- User activity monitoring

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### **GET /api/cloudinary/media**
```typescript
// Fast database-backed media retrieval
{
  items: MediaAsset[],
  pagination: PaginationInfo,
  stats: MediaStats,
  sync_status: SyncStatus
}
```

### **POST /api/cloudinary/sync**
```typescript
// Trigger bidirectional sync
{
  success: boolean,
  synced_items: number,
  updated_items: number,
  deleted_items: number,
